# Distinguishing Factual and Opinion Statements in the Presence of Online Social Groups

## Changes for CHI

Priority changes:
- [ ] add the “share on social media” buttons to the first page too (we can take out google+), important for self-propagating the study
- [ ] highlight the “who’s in this room?” Statement
- [ ] Add a target=“blank” to all the source links on the concluding page

UI Changes:
- [ ] Gender text form auto-completes as name: Male, Female, Prefer not to say, Non-binary
- [ ] Demographic: change default first option on forms to “Select option”
- [ ] change Newspaper to News publisher? (Align it with news source aggregators)
- [ ] typo: “Theres no data” —> “There is no data”
- [ ] typo: “Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid make” —> “makes”

Confusing points:
- [ ] define fact as capable of being proven/disproven on the main page
- [ ] emphasize the “capable of being proven/disproven with evidence” part
